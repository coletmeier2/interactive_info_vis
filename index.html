            "This sketch visualizes pasta's behavior when cooking in boiling water, showing the pasta curling over time.
            It's intended to be a functional timer for those who are visual learners."
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is intended for cooks that are visual learners, getting a visual concept of "doneness" 
              outside of the typical cook time; specifically for pasta in this case.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I made the color pallete various shades of earthy yellow, to match the pasta theme.
              I added a user input for cook time, as some people like their pasta at different levels of cooked. I was constrained on a set time because there needed to be some flexibility for different temperature waters.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future I would like to support different types of pasta. 
              I would also like to make it more realistic by either putting it on a plate or boiling in a pot.</li>

            For each 'notch' of time passed, I included a small space to simulate the vegetable being chopped for an additional signifier of time passing. I was constrained by how real I could make the vegetables look.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> In the future I would like to add a small knife chopping the vegetables as time passes.

        Both productivity and average compensation are indexed to 1948 (set to 100) to show relative growth over time.

            <h2>Why did you choose the dataset and story?</h2>
            <p>
              I chose this dataset because it clearly illustrates one of the most critical economic shifts of the modern era, 
              the growing gap between worker productivity and average compensation. Since the mid-20th century, productivity has 
              continued to rise steadily, while wages for the average worker have stagnated. This divergence is a direct reflection 
              of widening wealth inequality and changing economic structures. Visualizing it helps make an abstract economic trend 
              tangible and emotionally resonant.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Why did you choose that title for your story?</h2>
            <p>
              The title, <strong>“When Work Outpaces Wages”</strong>, captures the core imbalance the visualization revealing that 
              productivity and effort are no longer rewarded proportionally. It's short, memorable, and conveys motion and disparity. 
              The phrasing also encourages the viewer to question <em>why</em> this imbalance exists and who benefits from it.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Explain, is it author-driven or user-driven? What visualization genre is it?</h2>
            <p>
              This visualization is primarily <strong>author-driven</strong>. It tells a clear story with a specific takeaway: 
              productivity has risen dramatically, while compensation has lagged far behind. However, it incorporates one layer 
              of interactivity, a <strong>slider</strong> that allows users to explore values year by year. This small amount of 
              user control strengthens engagement without disrupting the narrative flow. The genre is best described as a 
              <strong>narrative time-series visualization</strong>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>If you could walk someone through this visualization in a talk, how would you describe it?</h2>
            <p>
              I would begin by explaining that both productivity and average compensation are indexed to 1948, meaning they start 
              at the same baseline of 100. As the years progress, the blue line representing productivity, climbs sharply, 
              reflecting gains in efficiency, technology, and worker output. The orange line average compensation, rises at first, 
              but soon flattens, revealing a widening gap. The slider lets the viewer scrub through time, visually witnessing the 
              separation between the two metrics grow decade by decade. The story being communicated is that economic growth has not 
              translated into proportional wage growth for the average worker.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>What are the main design principles that guided your encoding choices?</h2>
            <p>
              The main principles were <strong>contrast, simplicity, and time-based clarity</strong>. I used two distinct, 
              high-contrast colors, blue for productivity, and orange for compensation, to create immediate visual differentiation. 
              Both series were indexed to the same baseline, allowing viewers to focus on relative change rather than absolute numbers. 
              The layout and scale emphasize the longitudinal trend, while minimal text keep the focus on movement over time.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>How did you ensure clarity, hierarchy of concepts, and memorability?</h2>
            <p>
              To ensure clarity, I kept the visual space clean and focused, limiting clutter and emphasizing the divergence between 
              the two lines. Hierarchy was established through consistent placement: The title at the top, legend beneath it, and 
              timeline progression from left to right. The y-axis label “Indexed Value (1948 = 100)” anchors the viewer's understanding 
              of relative change. Memorability comes from the emotional punch of the widening gap itself, a simple, visual metaphor 
              for economic inequality that sticks in the viewer's mind long after they've interacted with it.
